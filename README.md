# ECE-528-Embedded-Systems-Machine-Learning-Assignments
The first assignment deals with increasing the neural network model accuracy with the use of batch normalization method and the addition of dropout layers.
The second assignment deals with Network Architecture Search, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Transfer Learning to identify which optimization function performs the best for different pre-trained neural network models.
The third assignment deals with neural network model optimization where different model optimization and compression techniques employed to train the neural network without affecting its performance for real-time usage in embedded platforms. 
The fourth assignment deals with Hardware/Software Co-design to study the performance of pre-trained neural network models for different mapping schemes and fixed parameter values such as bandwidth, L1 and L2 cache size.
The fifth assignment deals with time series forecasting and anomaly predictions to study the performance of linear regression neural network model and recurrent neural network model.
